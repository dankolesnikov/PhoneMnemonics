# Phone Mnemonics Problem

![](pic.jpg)

Scala's founder, Martin Odersky, uses this problem to show off the power of Scala and functional programming paradigm.

Given a phone number, what is the word sequence spelled on the touch-tone pad? 

Example:

* For 435 569 6753, return "hello world" among other sequences.
* For 7225247386, return "scala is fun" among others.

## Implementation

This implementation slightly differs from Martin Odersky's solution. No recursion, only higher-order functions! (map, flatMap, reduce)
